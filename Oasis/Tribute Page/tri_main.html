      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Veer Savarkar, also known as Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, was an Indian independence activist, poet, writer, and
        political leader. He was born on May 28, 1883, in Bhagur, Maharashtra, India, and passed away on February 26,
        1966, in Mumbai, India. Savarkar played a significant role in the Indian independence movement and was one of
        the key figures who advocated for a free India.

      <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
      <p>
        Veer Savarkar was born into a Marathi-speaking Hindu family. From an early age, he showed exceptional
        intelligence and a keen interest in literature. He pursued his education at Fergusson College in Pune, where he
        developed a passion for writing and public speaking. Savarkar was deeply influenced by the works of Swami
        Vivekananda and Bal Gangadhar Tilak, which inspired his patriotism and dedication to the cause of India's
        freedom.

      <h2>Political Activism and Nationalism</h2>
      <p>
        Savarkar's nationalist activities started during his college years when he founded the secret society "Abhinav
        Bharat" to promote revolutionary ideas. He strongly believed in armed resistance against British colonial rule
        and actively advocated for complete independence.

      <h2>Arrest and transportation to India</h2>
      <p>In India, Ganesh Savarkar had organized an armed revolt against the Morley-Minto reforms of 1909.[32] Savarkar was accused of participating in a conspiracy to overthrow the British government in India by organizing murders of various officials.[33] Hoping to evade arrest, Savarkar moved to Bhikaiji Cama's home in Paris,[34] but against advice from his friends, returned to London. On 13 March 1910, he was arrested in London on multiple charges, including procurement and distribution of arms, waging war against the state, and delivering seditious speeches. At the time of his arrest, he was carrying several revolutionary texts, including copies of his own banned books. In addition, the British government had evidence that he had smuggled 20 Browning handguns into India, one of which Anant Laxman Kanhere used to assassinate the British official A.M.T. Jackson in December 1909.[33]

        Although his alleged crimes were committed both in Britain, as well as India, the British authorities decided to try him in India. He was accordingly put on the commercial ship Morea with a police escort for his transport to India. When the ship docked in the French Mediterranean port of Marseille, Savarkar escaped by jumping from the ship's window, swam to the French shore, and asked for political asylum. The French port officials ignored his pleas, and handed him back to his British captors. When the French government came to know of this incidence, they asked for Savarkar to be brought back to France, and lodged an appeal with the Permanent Court of Arbitration.[35][33]</p>
